# Web-Scraping

## Summary & Purpose
While applying for jobs, I was given the task to utilize scrapy and selenium to web scrape Amazon products and place the 
information into a csv file. This was of high interest to me as I had kept an eye on web scraping due to a previous project I had
worked on. The task was siple enough, but it was quite insightful in learning web scraping via python and was an enjoyable experience.

## Instructions
-To start up this program, you will need to head to the project`s directory via the command prompt.

-type #scrapy crawl Amazon_Info -o items.csv and run the Spider.
