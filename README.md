# Web_Scraping

## Summary 
I was given the task to utilize scrapy and selenium to web scrape Amazon products and place the information into a csv file. This was of high interest to me at the time, as the concept of web-scraping was becoming more relevant to me due to a previous hackathon project I had worked on. At the time, I attempted web-scraping to create the basis of my application, but I did not have the time capacity left to accomplish this.

## Purpose
This side-project came as a result of job hunting at the time. I was approached with a job opportunity, but they wished to test my coding skills by providing me with a mock assignment. While I unfortunately did not get the position, it was a learning experience in a topic I had very little knowledge in. 

## Instructions
-To start up this program, you will need to head to the project's directory via the command prompt.

-type scrapy crawl Amazon_Info -o items.csv and run the Spider.
